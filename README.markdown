# What is this?
These are James'ss shell configuration dotfiles. The goal is to increase CLI productivity on Linux (mainly Ubuntu) and OSX, though many scripts run just fine on any POSIX implementation.

# Focus
The focus is on Bash support.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo are based on Jim Lawton's original which is in turn based on Matthew McCullough's original (https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles). Others have been created over the years and gathered here.
